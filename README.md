# Flux-like Riot Todo Application

This minimalist didactic application is written using the React-like [Riot](https://muut.com/riotjs/) UI library:

- Written in ES6.
- Compiled using [6to5](http://6to5.org/).
- Bundled with [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/).
- Uses browser LocalStorage for persistence.

The app is a port of my [Flux Backbone Todos Example](https://github.com/srackham/flux-backbone-todo) and I wrote it to learn and evaluate Riot.

## Differences between this application and the Flux Backbone Todos Example
1. Uses [Riot](https://muut.com/riotjs/) UI library instead of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).
2. Uses [RiotControl](https://github.com/jimsparkman/RiotControl) (slightly modified) instead of the [Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux) dispatcher.
3. Writes to browser LocalStorage directly instead of using [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/).

Apart from that the application functionality and architecture is the same.
